# Base Licence `AGPL-3.0-or-later`
Why did i choose this licence? For this specific line right here:
> When a modified version is used to provide a service over a network, the complete source code of the modified version must be made available.

_Found on [choosealicence.com](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/);_

This seems to be a good all around licence to ensure all parties are getting the same access to Opensource Software software..
