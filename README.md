# Modelo ðŸ§®ðŸ¤–

Spanish for Template, Modelo is a general purpose repo template for @tundradawn. I wanted to call it Nodelo, for node purposes... but if we need a template repo specfically for node i think we'll cross that road at that time.


# Contents

##### `.gitignore`
- ignores node elements, common UNIX elements such as `.DS_Store` and more.

##### `.editorconfig`
- ensure spacing and other fine factors of the coding life are consistant acrosses not only IDE's but also OS enviroments.

##### `.eslintrc.js`
- Contains common eslint rules with a small selection of simple ignores to aid in fast building of repos.
- Uses the Airbnb ruleset thanks to the suggestion from @jadnco

##### `.gitattributes`
- Forces all binary and text files to follow consistant line ending rules, as some team members work with Windows and others Mac.

# Base Licence `AGPL-3.0-or-later`
Why did i choose this licence? For this specific line right here:
> When a modified version is used to provide a service over a network, the complete source code of the modified version must be made available.

_Found on [choosealicence.com](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/);_

This seems to be a good all around licence to ensure all parties are getting the same access to Opensource Software software..
